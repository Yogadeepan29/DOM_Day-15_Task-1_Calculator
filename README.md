In this Repository, I have completed Day 15 DOM Manipulation task

==> Task-1 ( Calculator-Task )

    I have built a Calculator web application using HTML DOM , CSS and Bootstrap for this task.

      * Created a calculator using DOM.
      * Used Keyboard events only for numbers.
      * When any keys pressed other than number keys show an alert warning "Only numbers are allowed".
      * Added functions to perform addition, subtraction, division, multiplication and modulus.
      * This calculator can handle infix expressions.
      * Used DOM to create html elements
      * For styles I used css and bootstrap.
      * UI is responsive for all media screens.
      * Included the test suite in html file.
